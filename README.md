# different-problems-different-languges
Here are my homeworks for the course Computer Simulations in Physics (2023 Spring). I thought it could be fun to write the answers for each problem set with a different programing language (some of which i know how to code and some i don't). This repository is not complete yet because the course is ongoing but i'll try to keep it up to date.
